        Code becomes modular &  Takes a lot of extra coding  \\ 
        Decect bugs early & Can result in major changes to the code later   \\ 
        Cheaper to fix &  Require often reconfiguration of suites  \\
        Refactorring becomes easier &  Hard to make well defined tests  \\      
        Faster development &  A lot of wasted time in constant changing code \\ 
        Cleaner code &  Steep learning curve  \\

        Easy to do and understand &  Expensive to maintaine  \\ 
        Code is ls less complex & Testing can become too wide  \\ 
        Does not require extra refractoring &  Bugs are discovered late in development  \\
        Has a lot less code & No pre-testing of new functions  \\  
        & Risk of missing new bugs  \\  \hline
