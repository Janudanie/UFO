\subsection{TDD vs TLD - Pros and cons}
 
Each of the two test strategies has their pros and cons. Some of the most common pros and cons can be seen 
in the tabel figure 
\ref{table: procons}

    \begin{tabular}{|l | l|}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{TDD} \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons}  \\ \hline
        Code becomes modular &  Takes a lot of extra coding  \\ 
        Decect bugs early & Can result in major refactorring later   \\ 
        Cheaper to fix &  Require often reconfiguration of suites  \\
        Refactorring becomes easier &  Hard to make well defined tests  \\      
        Faster development &  A lot of wasted time in constant changing code \\ 
        Cleaner code &  Steep learning curve  \\

        \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons}  \\ \hline
        Easy to do and understand &  Expensive to maintaine  \\ 
        Code is ls less complex & Testing can become too wide  \\ 
        Does not require extra refractoring &  Bugs are discovered late in development  \\
        Has a lot less code & No pre-testing of new function introducing new bugs  \\  \hline
