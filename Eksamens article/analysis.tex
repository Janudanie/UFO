\section{Analysis}
\label{section:analysis}
The analysis will be composed from a range of articles and write-ups by authors who argue for and against TDD or TLD. 
Some will also be more objective views and focus more on the comparison of the two, and when one excels over the other. 
Some of the articles will be subjective with the purpose of getting you to subscribe to one strategy. 
Then build a conclusion from their citations and experience.
