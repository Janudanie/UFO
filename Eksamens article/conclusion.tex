\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
It is hard to say which method is the best for testing. According to Susan Hammond~\cite{sh2019}, it is na√Øve to claim that TDD is better, because it is not simple to define or measure if something is TDD.

The conclusion is therefore not going to point to TDD or to TLD as the best way to go. Ideally it is up to every individual team to decide from project to project, if they should use TDD or TLD for this project. Understandably this will not really happen, the more realistic scenario will be, that the team will stick to one method, and use that exclusively. This might overtime prove just as good, considering that the team will become a lot better to that testing method.
