\section{Conclusion}

Each strategy has its own strength and weakness, 
but the learning curve of the two approaches is one of the big 
factors when choosing. If you have a more experienced developer team, 
that has the discipline and overview to write a test first, and 
then write the method. Then the team should consider TDD over TLD. As it does provide a lager tests coverage and fewer bugs and maintainence. 
If the developer team has less experience, and are more of the “I need this to work now” kind of developer, 
the TLD approach should be considered. But a team should later concider if TDD is suited for them
and find ways to adopt into their team.
