\subsection{Problem definition}
\label{section:problem}
It is easy to develop an application from a list of speccifications,
 but it is a lot harder to make it bug free and stabel. 
 To help avoid these problems, developers use the strong tool of testing code. 
 But how should a program be tested. 
 This articel will look at two different approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Test Driven Development (TDD)
\item Last Test Development (LTD) 
\end{itemize}
Then conclude which of the two strategies is best suited the assignment at hand.



\subsection{Constraints}
There will be a few constraints that has been taken into consideration.
TDD and TLD is far from the only methods of testing during code development.
However this article will be limited to the differences between TDD and TLD.
