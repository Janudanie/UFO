\label{section:hypothesis}

The hypothesis is 
that TDD is the superior testing strategy compared to TLD.\newline

 
The general philosophy in many articles and teaching institutes is that TDD is the right way to go when testing code, 
compared to other strategies like TLD. The hypothesis is that TDD is way more effective at covering all the code, 
as the developer programs the test on the way to the finished product.  
Where TLD is very time consuming, it is often placed at the end of the development cycle. 
This makes it harder to account for the time needed for a full system testing. 
It is easier to forget certain functions and can result in a lot of technical debts. 
In the TDD approach, the developerteam account for the testing when developing the function.
