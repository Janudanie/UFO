\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}



The objective of this article is to research the best approach to test code during development. 
The two different testing strategies covered in this article will be test driven development (TDD) and test last development (TLD). 
The article will try and explain the difference between the two, and through the perspective of multiple articles by different authors, 
and conclude on which strategy is the most efficient way to probably test your application code.  

The article is build up of four sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Probelm definition~\ref{section:problem}:}
This will define excatly what the probelm needed to solved is.
\item \textbf{Hypothesis~\ref{section:hypothesis}:}
This will explain what the right answer might be. 
\item \textbf{Analysis~\ref{section:analysis}}:
This will be an analysis of the hypotese.
\item \textbf{Conclusion~\ref{section:conclusion}}:
This will a conlusion of the Analysis.
\end{itemize}
