\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}



The objective of this article is to research the best approach to test code during development. 
The two different testing strategies covered in this article will be test driven development (TDD) and test last development (TLD). 
The article will try and explain the difference between the two, through the perspective of multiple articles. 
Then conclude on which strategy is the most efficient way to probably test your application code.  

The article is build up of four sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Probelm definition~\ref{section:problem}:} 
\item \textbf{Hypothesis~\ref{section:hypothesis}:}
\item \textbf{Analysis~\ref{section:analysis}}:
\item \textbf{Conclusion~\ref{section:conclusion}}:
\end{itemize}
