## 10 tech challenges solved by microservices


##### 1. *Upfront name of author and organization.*
This blog is written by Maria Terskikh

##### 2. *Upfront Contact information (email address, phone number, physical address, etc.)*  
  There is no contact information

##### 3. *Bio, Credentials, About Us (or About Me), Profile information.*  
No bio or anything else, just a link to their twitter and telegram

##### 4. *Blogroll of already-known-to-be-credible blogs...and not just "clinking" (i.e., linking in a cliquey or cultish manner, linking only to friends, only to blogs on same host, only to blogs with same political beliefs, etc.)*  
Nothing of this. No links to support the blog.

##### 5. *Hypertext links leading to reputable sources of information.*  
Again no links to anything then themself.

##### 6. *Professional appearance, good use of visual elements, non-amateurish design.*  
Looks good. They have use some time setting this up

##### 7. *No overwhelming clutter of ads, no hardcore sales hype, no cheesy gimmicks designed to attract your attention.*  
I think it is an add to be honest.

##### 8. *No ax to grind that makes the blog author seem unreasonably bitter, condemning, fanatic, super-hostile, paranoid, crude, racist, sexist, misanthropic, or vulgar.*  
Nothing of the sort. 

##### 9. *Reasonable, rational language--with explanations, definitions, clarifications, links to substantiating information, as needed or appropriate.*  
Lot of cases where microservices saved the day. No links to confirm the story though.

##### 10. *Free from comment spam. The blogger monitors and deletes it quickly. It doesn't sit there in the blog for days or weeks at a time.*  
There is an two year old comment about an error in document. Error seem fixed.

##### 11. *Free from sleazy sponsored links, like the comment spam URLs mentioned above, only these dubious or malicious links are actually paid text link ads displayed on the blog by the author. Vile.*
No sleazy links, just their own link to their differnt accounts. 

##### 12. *Free from excessive typos, wrong spellings, bad grammar.*
Did not spot any,

##### 13. *References to reputable sources in the text itself. (Careful, this can be faked, I mean the reputable references may be plugged in just to gain your trust.)*
None.  

##### 14. *Good remarks by reputable persons, when you "google" or do a search engine search on the blog title or blogger (blog author) name.*
Could not find anything. Company seems dead, no twitter udpates for 2 years  
  
##### 15. *Relatively reserved tone of voice, dignified, not rampantly ecstatic, not excessively zealous, not fanatically frenzied...but then again you don't want an urgent message to be too sedate and casual!*    
This is an add for their product, not a real blog, ofcourse its gonna be in a good language.  

##### 16. *Tolerance of opposing points of view, not deleting comments that disagree with author, displaying hostile and flaming comments, with good responses to them.*  
There is nothing of the sort. (But i can not see a history of the blogs, so they might have deletede something)

##### 17. *Blog author responds in timely manner to emails and posted comments from readers, and responds--at least once in a while--within the comment threads, and not just in a summarizing post.*  
The whole company seems dead for almost 2 years, and there is no contact button.
The guy whole wrote about an error in the blog, did not get a thank you though.

## After A Year Of Using NodeJS In Production
##### 1. *Upfront name of author and organization.*  
Yes, it was written by Gavin Vickery.

##### 2. *Upfront Contact information (email address, phone number, physical address, etc.)*
No, but links to his other accounts was there, none of them worked though. 

##### 3. *Bio, Credentials, About Us (or About Me), Profile information.*
Does not say anything about him, or the company he works for.

##### 4. *Blogroll of already-known-to-be-credible blogs...and not just "clinking" (i.e., linking in a cliquey or cultish manner, linking only to friends, only to blogs on same host, only to blogs with same political beliefs, etc.)*
There are no links to other blogs, this is just his experience with Node.js.

##### 5. *Hypertext links leading to reputable sources of information.*
No, there are not any links that lead to reputable sources of information. But again, this is just his experience using Node.js.

##### 6. *Professional appearance, good use of visual elements, non-amateurish design.*
He does aproach the issue nicely, he starts out writing about how easy Node.js is to get startede with. Then he presents the problems, follows with a conclusion and ends with how he works now.

##### 7. *No overwhelming clutter of ads, no hardcore sales hype, no cheesy gimmicks designed to attract your attention.*
No, nothing of the sort.

##### 8. *No ax to grind that makes the blog author seem unreasonably bitter, condemning, fanatic, super-hostile, paranoid, crude, racist, sexist, misanthropic, or vulgar.*
He does not come off like he is mad or hate Node.js, he even comes up with examples of how he would recommend using it.

##### 9. *Reasonable, rational language--with explanations, definitions, clarifications, links to substantiating information, as needed or appropriate.*
No, there are no link, but he does state how he found Node.js. This seems like a diary of a sort, its basicly him, after a year, summing up how he felt about Node.js.

##### 10. *Free from comment spam. The blogger monitors and deletes it quickly. It doesn't sit there in the blog for days or weeks at a time.*
No, he has not removed comments, there is a comment *Old good HTTPD* which doesnt really add anything, he might have removed that.

##### 11. *Free from sleazy sponsored links, like the comment spam URLs mentioned above, only these dubious or malicious links are actually paid text link ads displayed on the blog by the author. Vile.*
There is nothing like this.

##### 12. *Free from excessive typos, wrong spellings, bad grammar.*
Yes, seems fair descent.

##### 13. *References to reputable sources in the text itself. (Careful, this can be faked, I mean the reputable references may be plugged in just to gain your trust.)*
No, there is no links

##### 14. *Good remarks by reputable persons, when you "google" or do a search engine search on the blog title or blogger (blog author) name.*
None, he has his own company.

##### 15. *Relatively reserved tone of voice, dignified, not rampantly ecstatic, not excessively zealous, not fanatically frenzied...but then again you don't want an urgent message to be too sedate and casual!*
I think he is very to the point, and lay out the facts fine.

##### 16. *Tolerance of opposing points of view, not deleting comments that disagree with author, displaying hostile and flaming comments, with good responses to them.*
Dont think he has even read the comments.

##### 17. *Blog author responds in timely manner to emails and posted comments from readers, and responds--at least once in a while--within the comment threads, and not just in a summarizing post.*
Would not know. There is no asnwers from him.
