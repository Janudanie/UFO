* What are the three most important problems with using Scrum?
* What are three important problems with using Scrum?

Try to find evidence for one problem in using Scrum, and try to assess the validity of the claims.


### Answer 1
I think the second option is the easiest, the first is more strict, you need to find the three MOST important problems using scrum
this means you need to find every problem with scrum, and make a top 3 of it all. Gonna take alot of time


### Answer 2
One problem can be, if the product owner do not understand the business needs, i can be hard to move forward at a steady pace, and you would have alot of downtime when the product owner is trying to figure you the needs
